                            <p>Iâ€™m 24 years old and currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. Before discovering my passion for the diverse world of technology, I was enrolled in an Accounting program. I paused those studies in 2022 after being selected for a Bootcamp sponsored by STONE, where I completed six intensive months focused on Web Development with an emphasis on React and Node.js. In April of the following year, I landed my first opportunity in tech as a development intern. In 2024, I joined the Dev Training program and secured my second role in the field. </p>
